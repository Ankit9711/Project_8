🎓 Student Management System – Python (OOP Based)
Student Management System is a Python mini project built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
This project is designed to help beginners understand classes, objects, constructors, methods, and data encapsulation in a practical way.
The program allows storing and displaying student details using a clean and structured OOP approach.
📌 Features
Create student objects using a class
Store student details (name, roll number, marks, etc.)
Display student information neatly
Uses constructor (__init__) for initialization
Clean and optimized OOP structure
Beginner-friendly Python code
🗂️ File Structure
Copy code

student-management/
│
├── student.py      # Main Python file (OOP code)
└── README.md       # Project documentation
⚙️ How It Works
A Student class is defined
Constructor initializes student data
Methods are used to display or process data
Objects of the class represent real students
Code follows proper OOP principles
▶️ How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Make sure Python is installed
Copy code
Bash
python --version
2️⃣ Open terminal in project folder
3️⃣ Run the program
Copy code
Bash
python student.py
🧠 Concepts Used
Classes and Objects
Constructor (__init__)
Instance variables
Methods
Encapsulation
Clean code structure
Basic data validation (if applied)
🎯 Purpose of This Project
This project is created to:
Learn Object-Oriented Programming in Python
Convert real-life entities into classes
Improve code readability and structure
Understand how optimized OOP code works
Build a strong foundation for advanced Python projects
🚀 Future Improvements
Multiple students handling using lists
Update and delete student records
File handling for data persistence
Result / grade calculation
Menu-driven CLI system
